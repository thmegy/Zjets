\section{Conclusions}

A test of CP-invariance in the Higgs boson coupling to vector bosons has been performed using the vector boson fusion production mode and the di-tau decay. The dataset collected by ATLAS at a centre-of-mass energy of 8~\TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 20.3 \ifb, is used. Event selection, background estimation and evaluation of systematic uncertainties are all following very closely the ATLAS analysis that provided evidence for the \Htt\ decay. 

An optimal observable is constructed and utilised, and is shown to provide a substantially improved sensitivity compared to the variable traditionally proposed for this kind of study, \signdphi. No sign of CP-violation is observed. Only the di-leptonic and semi-leptonic \Htt\ channels are used. In the range considered, \dtilde\ values of [-0.11,0.05] are found to be consistent with the data at the 1$\sigma$ level. The present analysis has no sensitivity at the 2 $\sigma$ level with the run-1 dataset -- however increased statistics with LHC's run-2 and consideration of additional Higgs decay channels should make this approach highly competitive.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

This note presents a study of the CP properties of the Higgs boson, using the Vector Boson Fusion (VBF) production mode and the $\tau\tau$ final state. More specifically, through the VBF production mode, the $HVV$ tensor structure is probed, in order to determine its CP nature. Possible signs of CP-odd contributions, if present, would be an unequivocal signal of new physics since in the Standard Model this coupling only has a CP-even term; a CP-violating Higgs sector could have enormous consequences also for the fundamental question of baryon asymmetry in the universe. 

In the past, a method to do such a measurement based on the azimuthal angle between the two jets produced in the VBF mode was proposed~\cite{Hankele}, and subsequent phenomenological/sensitivity studies have generally assumed this approach. In the present work a new approach is followed, making use of the so-called \emph{Optimal Observable}. The Optimal Observable was used e.g. in studies of CP invariance in \Ztt\ by the OPAL collaboration~\cite{OOOPAL}, but has not before been used in the context of Higgs VBF production  -- in this sense the present study can also be considered a proof-of-principle. It should be noted that the methodology is independent of the decay channel of the Higgs boson and could thus be applied to any final state produced via VBF -- in the present note the $\tau\tau$ final state is used, since the ATLAS analysis in that channel relies quite heavily on the VBF production mode, and thus a relatively large number of such events are expected to be present in the sensitive regions. 

The analysis presented in this note is therefore based on, and follows very closely, the ATLAS analysis used to establish $4.5\sigma$ evidence for the \Htt\ decay~\cite{EvidencePaper} (referred to in the following as \emph{the couplings analysis}). The same split into channels based on the decay of the $\tau$ lepton (denoted \tll, \tlhad\ and \thadhad) is followed, although of course in each of these only the VBF category is used. The same background estimation methods are also used, and all systematic uncertainties considered in the couplings analysis are also included here. The present note does not intend to reproduce all that information (for that the reader is directed to the corresponding documentation of the couplings analysis~\cite{EvidencePaper, HtautauSupport, EmbeddingSupport}), but rather focuses on the analysis aspects which have been modified in order to perform the intended measurement. 

Section~\ref{sec:theory} gives an overview of the theoretical background including the parametrisation used to express the CP-mixing scenarios considered, while Section~\ref{sec:oo} presents the motivation and definition of the Optimal Observable. Section~\ref{sec:samples} describes the samples used in this analysis, and in particular also the reweighting procedure applied on the signal samples to obtain the various CP-mixing scenarios. Section~\ref{sec:analysis} contains a description of the analysis itself, focusing on the differences to the couplings analysis, while Section~\ref{sec:systematics} presents the systematic uncertainties considered. Section~\ref{sec:fit} describes the fitting procedure followed to perform the measurement, with Section~\ref{sec:results} then presenting the obtained results. Finally, Section~\ref{sec:conclusions} provides some conclusions and outlook.

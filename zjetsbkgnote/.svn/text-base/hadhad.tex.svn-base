\section{Description of all-hadronic analysis}
\label{app:hadhad}

This section addresses the absence of the fully hadronic di-tau final state from the bulk of this analysis. Despite a signal region that is less densely populated than the \tlhad signal region, it is hoped that the inclusion of the fully hadronic final state will improve the sensitivity to CP-odd couplings. 

\subsection{Analysis Description}
As with the other analysis channels the preselection and signal region definitions are identical to the VBF category of the couplings analysis~\cite{EvidencePaper} except for an additional cut on the BDT discriminant (\bdtscore > 0.57) which is defined as the highest 3 bins of the BDT distribution in \thadhad. The classifier distribution used in the the VBF pre-selection region is shown in figure~\ref{fig:plot_hadhad_full_BDT}.

Figure~\ref{fig:plot_hadhad_oo_sr}(a) demonstrates that the optimal observable can be produced for various CP-mixing signal models for the fully hadronic final state. Figure~\ref{fig:plot_hadhad_oo_sr}(b) shows how different CP-mixing models will produce different optimal observable shapes. To assess the dependence of the BDT cut on the optimal observable, the mean values of \oo are shown for each bin of the classifier for various samples. This can be seen in figure~\ref{fig:plot_hadhad_oo_by_bdt_bin} Since no clear trend between \oo and \bdtscore can be seen, the top 3 bins of this distribution will be used for a signal region and the lowest two for a control region.

In the \thadhad channel, as seen in Figure~\ref{fig:plot_hadhad_oo_sr}(a) the dominant backgrounds come from $Z\rightarrow\tau\tau$ and QCD multi-jet production in which two jets both produce fake taus. Unlike the other channels there are no dedicated Z or top control regions. The shape of the optimal observable is verified via the inclusion of the `rest' control region into the simultaneous fit. This region is defined as that region that passes all VBF selection criteria but then fails the BDT cut of 0.57. This low BDT region is shown in figure~\ref{fig:plot_hadhad_crs}.

\subsection{Expected Sensitivity}
The sensitivity to CP-odd couplings is estimated using a maximum-likelihood fit to the various signal and control regions as described in section 7. Two approaches are used to assess the sensitivity of the blinded analysis; An `Asimov' data set is constructed to represent the data, and the results of fitting our model to this data set compared to a `hybrid' data set constructed from `Asimov' data in the signal region and real data used else where. This pseudo data is constructed using the background and non-CP mixed signal models with a nominal $\mu$ value of 1.0. Figure~\ref{fig:oo_nll} demonstrates this expected sensitivity under the assumption of no BSM effects.

In addition to the systematic variations that were all investigated and documented in detail in the evidence paper analysis, a series of additional systematic variations were investigated. These shape variations can be seen in figures~\ref{fig:plot_hadhad_qcd_scale}-~\ref{fig:plot_hadhad_reweight} and represent the choice of PDF, the QCD scale, underlying event/parton shower and reweighting normalisation and shape uncertainties, as described in section 6.1.\\

To test the effect of the systematic variations on this analysis, a ranking of the nuisance parameters was created for this particular fit model. The effect on the fit on \oo can be seen in figure~\ref{fig:plot_hadhad_ranking}

\subsection{$\Delta\phi_{jj}^{sign}$ Investigations}
As described in Appendix B, the variable $\Delta\phi_{jj}^{sign}$ is also sensitive to the CP-mixing coupling structure. 
%This variable only uses the angle between the two high $p_T$ jets in a VBF event and therefore provides a CP sensitive variable that is not dependent on the nature of the model being tested as in the Optimal Observable. 
The distribution of $\Delta\phi_{jj}^{sign}$ in the \thadhad channel is shown in figure ~\ref{fig:plot_hadhad_dphi_sr}. The fit procedure described for the optimal observable was repeated for $\Delta\phi_{jj}^{sign}$ and the results of the fit can be seen in figure \ref{fig:dphi_nll} b).

Extensive investigation was performed into the nature of the asymmetry seen in the nominal fit on figure \ref{fig:dphi_nll}. The nominal investigations into nuisance parameters profiles, pulls and correlations were extended in the hope that this tension on the fit model could be alleviated however all paramters fell within the confines of the behavior seen within the run1 coupling results. The conclusion reached is that the behaviour is due to statistical fluctuations in the fake estimate causing an asymmetry in that distribution (which is expected to be flat) that is then propagated into the Asimov dataset in the hybrid signal region. To validate this hypothesis, the fake estimate distribution was symmetrized by averaging bin contents around the minimum before generating the new asimov dataset for this averaged case. The effect of this is shown in figure \ref{fig:dphi_nll} a) where the statistical validity of this averaging is shown. Figure \ref{fig:dphi_nll} demonstrates that the asymmetry (and non-zero fit minimum) are indeed the effect of statistical fluctuations in the background model. Since this particular background model is data driven the effect is more pronounced especially given the overall expected sensitivity.

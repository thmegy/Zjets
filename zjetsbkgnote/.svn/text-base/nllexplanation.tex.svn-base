\section{Explanation of NLL curve behavior}
\label{app:nllex}

It is a well known fact that a distribution is fully characterised by its moments.
In the following we only consider the first and second moment in order to get an 
insight in the observed dependence of the {\it negative} $\Delta$  {\it log-likelihood (NLL)}
on the parameter of interest $\tilde{d}\,$, which parametrises the strength of a possible CP odd 
contribution to the maxtrix element. All integrals are performed over a CP-symmetric 
part of phase space. The considerations try to explain the expected {\it NLL} curve for
vanishing $\dtilde$ realised in nature.

The matrix element $\mathcal{M}$ for VBF production is the sum of a CP-even contribution 
$\mathcal{M}_{\textrm{SM}}$ from the SM and a CP-odd contribution $\mathcal{M}_{\textrm{CP-odd}}$ 
from the dimension six operators considered:
\begin{equation} 
\mathcal{M} =\mathcal{M}_{\textrm{SM}}+\dtilde\cdot\mathcal{M}_{\textrm{CP-odd}}.
\end{equation}
The squared matrix element and  differential cross section has three contributions:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:MEsquared}
|\mathcal{M}|^{2}=|\mathcal{M}_{\textrm{SM}}|^{2}+ 
\dtilde\cdot2\Re(\mathcal{M}_{\textrm{SM}}^{*}\mathcal{M}_{\textrm{CP-odd}}) +  \dtilde^{2}\cdot|\mathcal{M}_{\textrm{CP-odd}}|^{2} 
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:MEsquared}
d \sigma = d\sigma_{SM} + \tilde{d}\, d\sigma_{CP odd} + \tilde{d}^2 \, d\sigma_{CP\,even} \, .
\end{equation}

The first $|\mathcal{M}|^{2}$ ($d\sigma_{SM}$) and third term  
$\dtilde^{2}\cdot|\mathcal{M}_{\textrm{CP-odd}}|^{2}$ ($d\sigma_{CP\,even}$) 
are both CP-even and hence do not yield a source of CP violation. The second term 
$\dtilde\cdot2\Re(\mathcal{M}_{\textrm{SM}}^{*}\mathcal{M}_{\textrm{CP-odd}})$ ($d\sigma_{CP odd}$), 
stemming from the interference of the two contributions to the matrix element, is CP-odd and is a possible 
new source of CP-violation in the Higgs sector. The interference term integrated over a CP-symmetric part of phase 
space vanishes and does therefore not contribute to the total cross section and observed event yield after applying 
CP-symmetric selection criteria. The third term leads to an increase of the total cross section quadratic in $\dtilde$, 
which is however not exploited in the analysis presented here.

The analysis exploits the shape of distribution of the CP-odd optimal observable, which is 
defined in terms of the matrix elements as 
\begin{equation}
OO  =  \frac {2 {\cal{R}}e ({\cal{M}}_{SM}{\cal{M}}^*_{CP\,odd})}{|{\cal{M}}_{SM}|^2} 
\end{equation}

The first moment of $OO$ is given by:
\begin{equation}
<OO> = \frac {\int OO \,  d\sigma_{SM} + \tilde{d}\, d\sigma_{CP odd} + \tilde{d}^2 \, d\sigma_{CP\,even}}   
             {\int d\sigma_{SM} + \tilde{d}\, d\sigma_{CP\,odd} + \tilde{d}^2 \, d\sigma_{CP\,even}}   
\end{equation}
Due to the CP-odd character of the optimal observable the first and third term in the nominator
vanish and the mean value simplifies to:
\begin{equation}
<OO>  =  \frac {\tilde{d} \, \int OO  d\sigma_{CP\,odd}}   
                 {\int d\sigma_{SM} + \tilde{d}^2 \int d\sigma_{CP\,even}}   
\end{equation}

For small value of $\dtilde$ a linear rise with $\dtilde$ is expected as the term in the denominator 
proportional to $\dtilde^2$ is small compared to the SM contribution. For large values of $\dtilde$ this term
will dominate and the mean value will first scale approximately as $1/\dtilde$ and finally tend to the 
SM value of zero. 

The second moment of $OO$ is given by:
\begin{equation}
<OO^2> = \frac {\int OO^2 \,  d\sigma_{SM} + \tilde{d}\, d\sigma_{CP odd} + \tilde{d}^2 \, d\sigma_{CP\,even}}   
             {\int d\sigma_{SM} + \tilde{d}\, d\sigma_{CP\,odd} + \tilde{d}^2 \, d\sigma_{CP\,even}}   
\end{equation}
Due to the CP-even character of $OO^2$ the second term in the nominator vanishes and 
the expression simplifies to:
\begin{equation}
<OO^2>  =  \frac {\int OO^2  d\sigma_{SM}}{\int d\sigma_{SM} + \tilde{d}^2 \int d\sigma_{CP\,even}}   
+ \frac {\tilde{d}^2 \, \int OO^2  d\sigma_{CP\,even}}{\int d\sigma_{SM} + \tilde{d}^2 \int d\sigma_{CP\,even}}   
\end{equation}

The first term reproduces the moment of the SM for vanishing values of $\dtilde$ and then decreases
with $\dtilde^2$.  The second term vanishes for vanishing values of $\dtilde$ and then first increases 
approximately with $\dtilde^2$ and finally reaches a plateau independent on $\dtilde$.


We believe that the derived dependence of the first and second moments on $\dtilde$ allows to explain that 
the $NLL$ curve flattens off for large $\dtilde$ values as the first moment tends to zero and the second 
one gets independent on $\dtilde$.  Whether a local maximum in $NLL$ is observed at intermediate $\dtilde$
(e.g. for the signed azimuthal angle difference between the tagging jets) or not (e.g. for the optimal 
observable) depends on the numerical values of the first and second moments in the SM ($\dtilde =0$)
and for $\dtilde =1$ and their ratios, which are different for different observables.
